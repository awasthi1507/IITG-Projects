Our motive throughout the whole product developing phase was to maximise the energy harnessed by the solar panel in the limited time window available of solar radiation. For this, we propose a mechanism wherein the incidence of solar radiation will always be normal to the surface of the panel. We have tried to realize this by orienting the plane of the solar panel perpendicular to the area of maximum incident intensity via a motor at regular intervals.
